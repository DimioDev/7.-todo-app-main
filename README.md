# Frontend Mentor - Todo app

![Design preview for the Todo app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)


## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

### My Solution

This todo project has been achieved by HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla JS only (no frameworks).
